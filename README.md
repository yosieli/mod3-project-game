# mod-3_game
project for module 3 of flatiron school

When loading, make sure to change the link in "playable.js","monster.js", and "boss.js" to the full path for your computer of that folder name (folders for animasions are in "animations"). The code needs the full path there since it sometimes compares actions based on animations.

Also, in "variables.js", you will have to change the userURL and savefilesURL to whatever URL your database uses

#Bugs
spamming slash button with no directions glitches character (not sure if this still happens)
character max walking height doesn't changed based on background (looks like characters are walking in the sky)
